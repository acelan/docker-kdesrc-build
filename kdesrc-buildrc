# Instead of specifying modules here, the current best practice is to refer to
# KF5 module lists maintained with kdesrc-build by the KF5 developers. As new
# modules are added or modified, the kdesrc-build KF5 module list is altered to
# suit, and when you update kdesrc-build you will automatically pick up the
# needed changes.

# NOTE: You MUST change the path below to include the actual path to your
# kdesrc-build installation.
include /home/kdedev/kdesrc-build/kf5-qt5-build-include

# If you wish to maintain the module list yourself that is possible, simply
# look at the files pointed to above and use the "module-set" declarations that
# they use, with your own changes.

# It is possible to change the options for modules loaded from the file
# included above (since it's not possible to add a module that's already been
# included), e.g.
options kcoreaddons
    make-options -j4
